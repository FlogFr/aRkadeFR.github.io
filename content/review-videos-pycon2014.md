Summary: After a bit more than a week watching all the videos that interested me (basically the Django, Python Core and others) I offer you a quick review of my favorite one

You can find the videos of PyCon2014 [here](http://pyvideo.org/category/50/pycon-us-2014).

If you don't want to miss anything about the PyCon2014, there's couple of
videos I especially liked, and were gripping:

- ["What is async, How does it work and When should I use it?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WV7juNmyE8)
My favorite one far from the others. This talk was pure joy listening to someone
that knows how to catch the attention of the audience.
Numerous analogy very well picked up to draw the picture of the async mecanism.
Easy to follow, and easy to understand. Even on a specific subject like async.
If you have to watch only one talk, don't hesitate and watch this one.

- ["Cache me if you can"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Xmeynf1T4)
I wasn't especially interested by the subject, but I gave it a try cause of the
speaker. From the first minutes, we can see that the talk will give us an
in-depth understanding of the mecasnisms of caching (with memcached).
We see everything we expected: the pitfalls, the tips of when to use a
memcache... Just a big thanks cause time flew while watching it.

- ["Characters encoding and Unicode in Python"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx70n1dL534)
Boring stuff the encoding and decoding files? This talk is a very good one for
understanding what is happening under the hood in Python for encoding and
decoding bytes.
A special note: This talk is highly inspirated from the 2012 [talk of Ned
Batchelder](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/unipain.html) at PyCon. Even if this
talk give less tips (IMHO) than the one of 2014, it does cover very thoroughly
how python handle string/encoding/decoding.
